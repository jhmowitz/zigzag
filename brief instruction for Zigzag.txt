brief instruction for Zigzag.exe


1. startup keys:

ctrl-g: to start the process

start option 1: throw random points without container

'>'/'<': increase/decrease the start random number (useful for reproducing a particular configuration, other parameters being equal)

 
either: skip this step: both triangles and circles will be thrown
or: press '*' once: triangles only will be thrown
or: press '**' twice: circles only will be thrown


toggle 'w': 
do not press 'w': type 'continous' triangles will be visible
press 'w' once: type 'reflected' triangles will be visible
press 'w' twice: both triangle types will be visible
press 'w' thrice: no triangles will be visible
	(in our book "Movements of Form" the 'continuous' and 'reflected' types are shown in blue and green respectively)


press 'W' to toggle circles invisible/visible

choose a number between 1 and 9 and see the following:

'1'     // create one circle/triangle
'2'     // create two circles/triangles
'3'     //  5
'4'     // 10
'5'     // 20
'6'     // 50
'7'     // 100
'8'     // 200
'9'     // 500


start option 2: throw points within containing shape

press '.'
'l'/'L': zoom out/in
alt-l: zoom out a bit
'd'/'D'; decrease/increase density (number of points)
'f': toggle along various initial container shapes
only for rectangles: 'a'/'A': frame shorter/longer
'/': toggle without/with subframe
only for subframes: 'o'/'O': decrease/increase subframe
'q'/'Q': rotate frame counterclockwise/clockwise
alt-q: rotate frame a bit counterclockwise
't': toggle tesselation type
'e'/'E': decrease/increase the number of omitted points
'r'/'R': rotate tesselation counterclockwise/clockwise
alt-r: rotate a bit counterclockwise
'-'/'+': decrease/increase perturbation
':': start process



2. adjustment keys:
's' / 'S': zoom out/in
'x' / 'X': step left/right
'y' / 'Y': step down/up
'!': toggle between pause and resume
'+': increase process time step
'-': decrease process time step
'D': increase delay
'd': decrease delay
'W' and 'w': as above

'k': toggle between colors off/on
'K': toggle between on/off show expected developments encounter points 
after 'K': 
'F': increase time span of expected developments
'f': decrease time span of expected developments
alt-m: for triangles: toggle between contour lines and bisectors
alt-/: toggle draw cadre
alt-g: toggle draw generations of circles
after alt-g: 
'g': draw next circle generation
'G': draw previous circle generation

3. print keys
'p': this produces two snapshot image files, one zigzag.png and one zigzag.eps
F11: produces a snapshot series on a single eps file; F11 stops it
F12: produces a snapshot series on multiple eps files; F12 stops it
	The system folder in which the files are stored is mentioned in the 'console' tab.
'P': divide page into several pictures



examples:

A.
use the following sequence of keys:
ctrl-g 				(start run)
* 				(throw circles only)
ww				(show both triangle types)
>>				(start random number generator = 2)
4				(throw 10 circles & start process)


B.
use the following sequence of keys:
ctrl-g				(start run)
.				(show initial frame and circle points)
f				(choose triangle frame)				
DDD				(increase density)
++++				(increase perturbation)
ww				(show both triangle types)
:				(start process)


have fun!
